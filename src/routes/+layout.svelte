        how it is being done: 
        Here's a high-level overview of the process:

The onAuthStateChanged function listens for changes in the user's authentication state. If the user is not logged in and they are not trying to access a non-authenticated page, the function redirects the user to the root URL.

If the user is logged in, the function retrieves the user's data from the Firebase Firestore database.

If the user's data does not exist in the database, the function creates a new document for the user and sets their email and todos array.

If the user's data does exist in the database, the function retrieves the data and sets it to the dataToSetToStore  variable.

Finally, the function updates the authStore object with the user's authentication state, data, and loading status.

By following this process, the application ensures that the user's data is properly initialized and that the user is redirected to the appropriate pages based on their authentication state.

        //we also set it to a variable called unscribe
